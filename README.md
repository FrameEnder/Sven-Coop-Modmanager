Download the latest release here, and if you don't have it already get Python installed, I recommend Python 3.11. 

Then Simply run the Start.bat / Start.sh, and it will create a Virtual Enviroment, and install any requirements from the requirements.txt file provided.

  This will setup your enviroment, and install any requirements inside requirements.txt
